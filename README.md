# DotnetCoreQuasar
Starter template for dot net core quasar
This shows some promise for me.

The ASP.net project builds with no errors.
I am able to hit API endpoints in the browser like so:
[localhost:port/api/HelloWorld](localhost:port/api/HelloWorld)

I have not attempted to build the Quasar project.
